<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![homepage Screen Shot][homepage-screenshot]

As a challenge project for my personal porfolio, I decided to make a sorting visualizer. I was inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu, a popular youtube content creator and software engineer, to make a sorting visualizer as my portfolio project. 

The sorting visualizer should show the following:
-	merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, bubble sort 
-	visualizing sorting sequence
-	interactive was to change array size and sequence speed

### Built With

Below are the major frameworks/libraries used to for my project.

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Learning react was a goal of mine since late last year and I could not pass up on the opportunity.

When I was learning react, I noticed many tutorials were using mui and decided that it would be easier for me to use the mui library. 

I decided to use TypeScript in my project. This was because ts supports a tighter integration with the editor and type inference to gives me great tooling.
